This was the second meeting of py4science!

## Attendance

9 attendees, with an experience breakdown of about:

* Experienced: 7

* New: 

People came from the following departments and organizations:

* Neuroscience
* IPython
* Pyschology
* D-Lab
* Bioengineering
* Vision Science

### Working Groups

Dav gave a small blurb about working groups vs. the py4science
meeting, with the emphasis that py4science is more of "show and tell"
and py4text/py4data is more hands-on.

## Newbie Nugget

Presented by Cindee, the topic is about `if __name__ == "__main__"`

[IPython notebook for the newbie nugget]()

Min points out that you can write files in IPython notebook using the
`%%file` cell magic!

Jess mentions weirdness with `if __name__ == "__main__"` in emacs and
IPython (python-mode apparently ignores anything in the if statement).

## Lightning Talks

### What's New in IPython

Presented by Min

Awesome stuff: `%matplotlib`, `raw_input`, `nbconvert`, widgets

### Python 3

Presented by Thomas

Topics covered: `print`, iterators, unicode, function annotation for
typechecking and command line argument parsing, yield from and return
from generators

Useful tip: `python -o` will remove assert statements!
