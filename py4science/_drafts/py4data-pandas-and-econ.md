Notes

Recap

-We had eight people show up 
-This week people mostly worked independently on different projects. And in particular people are starting to work with their own data.
-Almost everyone is finding it useful to use pandas to read in their data sets and some people are starting to look at doing quantitative economics on their data.
-py4text is in the process of merging with py4data so that we have more skills and expertise in the room at once. 

Upcoming

-both organizers and py4data and py4text are entering a busy period of the semester and we're realizing we have conflicts with other important events on campus. 
so py4text and py4data meetings are on hold while we try to figure out the best time to accomodate interested members of the py4science community. No meeting this Friday, Oct 4 for py4science and py4data.
But the regular py4science meeting will meet on Wednesday. (will keep meeting on Wednesdays)
